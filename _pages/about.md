I am Daniel. I recently graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in Data Science.
I am currently looking for a job in a data-related position; Data Analyst, Data Scientist. That said, I am eager to apply data science to solve real-world problems.

This space will be used to write about my projects, experiences, and topics surrounding data science that interest me.
